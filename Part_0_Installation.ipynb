    "# Machine Learning Workshop: Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Install Git\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "2.  Run the installer, following the prompts.\n",
    "3.  Verify installation by opening a terminal and running:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Clone the Workshop Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Manual Download\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Navigate to the repository's GitHub page ([https://github.com/martin-pd/kida_ml_workshop](https://github.com/martin-pd/kida_ml_workshop)).\n",
    "2.  Click the green \"Code\" button and select \"Download ZIP.\"\n",
    "3.  Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Using Terminal (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open a terminal and navigate to your desired directory.\n",
    "2.  Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/martin-pd/kida_ml_workshop.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies. Choose either `venv` or `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `venv` (Python's Built-In)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.\n",
    "2.  Create a virtual environment named `venv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python -m venv venv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you don't have conda installed, install it from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n",
    "2.  Create a conda environment named `venv` with a specific Python version (e.g., 3.10):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda create --name venv python=3.10\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Replace \"venv\" with your preferred name and \"3.10\" with your desired Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Activating makes the environment's packages available in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For `venv`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **macOS/Linux:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **All operating systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda activate venv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Install Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Install project dependencies using either `pip` or `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.\n",
    "2.  Install packages from the `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.\n",
    "2.  From `environment.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda env update --file environment.yml --prune\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `--prune` flag removes any packages that are not listed in your environment.yml to keep your environment clean.\n"

    "\n",
    "We recommend that you configure your [Hugging Face User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens), and set it in your environment variables because we will use a LLM from the Hugging Face Hub. You can copy the resulting Access Token into the first code block of the Jupyter notebook `Part_3_Retrieval_Augmented_Generation.ipynb`, where we set the environment variable for Hugging Face `os.environ[\"HF_TOKEN\"] = \"\"`.\n",

    "## 1. Install Git\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "2.  Run the installer, following the prompts.\n",
    "3.  Verify installation by opening a terminal and running:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Clone the Workshop Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Manual Download\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Navigate to the repository's GitHub page ([https://github.com/SG-Trainings/kida_ml_workshop](https://github.com/SG-Trainings/kida_ml_workshop)).\n",
    "2.  Click the green \"Code\" button and select \"Download ZIP.\"\n",
    "3.  Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Using Terminal (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open a terminal and navigate to your desired directory.\n",
    "2.  Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/SG-Trainings/kida_ml_workshop.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.\n",
    "2.  Create a virtual environment named `venv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python -m venv venv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Activating makes the environment's packages available in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **macOS/Linux:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In VSCode: To select the right kernel corresponding to your virtual environment in VSCode, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your Jupyter notebook in VSCode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click on the \"Select Kernel\" button in the top-right corner of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the dropdown menu, choose \"Python Environments\" if it's available. If not, select \"Select Another Kernel...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Look for your virtual environment in the list. It should be named after the environment you created (e.g., \"venv\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you've selected the correct kernel, you should see it displayed in the top-right corner of your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Install Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Install project dependencies using `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.\n",
    "2.  Install packages from the `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation with Conda (This installation has not been tested. We recommend using pip.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you don't have conda installed, install it from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Alternatively, you can use Miniconda [https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/). \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Create a conda environment named `venv` with a specific Python version (e.g., 3.10):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda create --name venv python=3.10\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace \"venv\" with your preferred name and \"3.10\" with your desired Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda activate venv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install requirements:`\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda env update --file environment.yml --prune\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--prune` flag removes any packages that are not listed in your environment.yml to keep your environment clean."

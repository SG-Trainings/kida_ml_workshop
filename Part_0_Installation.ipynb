    "# Machine Learning Workshop: Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your environment for the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Download Git:** Go to the official Git website ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.\n",
    "2.  **Install Git:** Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Use the default settings unless you have a specific reason to change them.\n",
    "3.  **Verify Installation:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This should display the version of Git that you have installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clone the Workshop Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop materials are stored in a Git repository. You'll need to clone this repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: Manual Download (if you have trouble with Git)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Navigate to the Repository:** Go to the repository's page on GitHub ([https://github.com/martin-pd/kida_ml_workshop](https://github.com/martin-pd/kida_ml_workshop)).\n",
    "2.  **Download ZIP:** Click the green \"Code\" button and select \"Download ZIP\".\n",
    "3.  **Extract ZIP:** Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer where you want to store the workshop materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: Using the Terminal (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open Terminal:** Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2.  **Navigate to Directory:** Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd Documents/Workshops`).\n",
    "3.  **Clone Repository:** Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/martin-pd/kida_ml_workshop.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a specific Python installation along with any additional packages you install. This allows you to isolate the workshop's dependencies from your system-wide Python installation and prevent conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Navigate to Project Directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned (or extracted) the repository.\n",
    "2.  **Create Virtual Environment:** Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python -m venv venv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can replace `venv` with any name you prefer for your virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use the virtual environment, you need to activate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "*   **macOS and Linux:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    After activation, your terminal prompt should be prefixed with the name of the virtual environment (e.g., `(venv)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Install Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop relies on several Python packages. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file located in the repository. You can install them using `pip`, the Python package installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Ensure Activation:** Make sure your virtual environment is activated.\n",
    "2.  **Install Packages:** Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file into your virtual environment.  If you encounter issues, ensure pip is up to date: `pip install --upgrade pip` and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to start the workshop!"
